I'm a **fullstack developer** from Stockholm, Sweden.

These days I'm mostly working with node, react, angular, dotnet core and vue, but I have been building iOS apps since 2011.
I love being in the intersection between technology and business strategy, which is why I've started 3 companies, each time to create something truly meaningful to others.  

### I'm currently working at [Natural Cycles](https://naturalcycles.com) as a Senior Fullstack Engineer
Natural Cycles is an ovulation tracker that serves both as a birth control and a fertility planner.

My main responsibility is to scale the payments infrastructure to handle millions of transactions

### I previously worked at [Heads](https://heads.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer.
Heads builds retail software, similar to Square Pay. My responsibilities include building and maintaining the react frontend, node backend and the Heads POS iOS app.

- The company website [heads.com](https://heads.com/) (Astro)
- The Heads Design System (React)
- The Heads POS app (iOS)
