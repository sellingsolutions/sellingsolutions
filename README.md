### Hi there, I'm Alex 👋

I love building things and solving problems that matter

## Currently working on iSpect, an app for building inspectors 👷‍♂️ 

iSpect stuff I've built so far:
- A simple [reporting tool](https://aterrapportering.stage.ispectapp.se/?token=ZGFtaWFuX2N6dWJhX2ptX3NlX19pcmVwb3J0bGl0ZV90b2tlbg%3D%3D&p=project_1519207592_dbdd0937-5d39-4896-9643-679536ebb2d6&f=) for construction companies
- A customer portal 

## Previously

I've helped co-found Buildcraft - an iPaaS for Construction; together with [Joachim Wester](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack) and [Anton Fagerberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aejfager/)

I'm also the founder of [iControl](https://icontrolapp.se/en), an app that replaces paper reports with a mobile app at construction sites.

iControl is a [500 Startups](https://500.co/) alumni - Batch 19.
