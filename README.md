I'm a **fullstack developer** living in Austin.

These days, I'm mostly working with node, react, angular, dotnet core, and vue, but I have been building iOS apps since 2011.
I love being in the intersection between technology and business strategy, which is why I've started 3 companies, each time to create something truly meaningful to others.  

### I'm currently working at [≈åURA](https://ouraring.com/) as Software Engineer in the Checkout Squad
The ≈åura smart ring is used to track sleep, physical activity, and your menstrual cycle with the help of its 7 temperature sensors.

#### I previously worked at [Natural Cycles](https://www.naturalcycles.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer in charge of Payments
